# Web2py Bootstrap Example

Using the [free bootstrap 3 template Margo](https://graygrids.com/item/margo-free-multi-purpose-bootstrap-template/) instead of the out-of-the-box bootstrap 2 framework in Web2py.

##Objective
To demonstrate how to use a third-party bootstrap template in the Web2py framework (and **entirely replaced the original bootstrap 2 template**).
This should be addressing issues like those ones: [web2py ggl-group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/9ipT2xkXMhc)
